# Chapter 8: Rational Numbers
## 8.1  INTRODUCTION
You began your study of numbers by counting objects around you. The numbers used for this purpose were called counting numbers or natural numbers. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, ... By including 0 to natural numbers, we got the whole numbers, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, ... The negatives of natural numbers were then put together with whole numbers to make up integers. Integers are ..., –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .... We, thus, extended the number system, from natural numbers to whole numbers and from whole numbers to integers.

You were also introduced to fractions. These are numbers of the form $\frac{numerator}{denominator}$, where the numerator is either 0 or a positive integer and the denominator, a positive integer. You compared two fractions, found their equivalent forms and studied all the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on them.

In this Chapter, we shall extend the number system further. We shall introduce the concept of rational numbers alongwith their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.

## 8.2  NEED FOR  RATIONAL  NUMBERS

Earlier, we have seen how integers could be used to denote opposite situations involving numbers. For example, if the distance of 3 km to the right of a place was denoted by 3, then the distance of 5 km to the left of the same place could be denoted by –5. If a profit of 150 was represented by 150 then a loss of  100 could be written as –100.

You can represent a distance of 750m above sea level as $\frac{3}{4}$ km. Can we represent 750m below sea level in km? Can we denote the distance of $\frac{3}{4}$ km below sea level by $\frac{-3}{4}$? We can see $\frac{-3}{4}$ is neither an integer, nor a fractional number. We need to extend our number system to include such numbers.

## 8.3  WHAT ARE  RATIONAL  NUMBERS ?
The word ‘rational’ arises from the term ‘ratio’. You know that a ratio like 3:2 can also be $\frac{3}{2}$ written as . Here, 3 and 2 are natural numbers.

Similarly, the ratio of two integers p and q (q ≠ 0), i.e., p:q can be written in the form $\frac{p}{q}$. This is the form in which rational numbers are expressed.

A rational number is defined as a number that can be expressed in the form
 $\frac{p}{q}$, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.

Thus, $\frac{4}{5}$ is a rational number. Here, p = 4 and q = 5.

- You have seen many fractions like $\frac{3}{8}$, $\frac{4}{8}$, 1$\frac{2}{3}$ etc. All fractions are rational numbers. Can you say why?
How about the decimal numbers like 0.5, 2.3, etc.? Each of such numbers can be written as an ordinary fraction and, hence, are rational numbers. For example, 0.5 = $\frac{5}{10}$, 0.333 = $\frac{333}{1000}$ etc.

**Numerator and Denominator**
In $\frac{p}{q}$ , the integer p is the numerator, and the integer q (≠ 0) is the denominator.
Thus, in $\frac{-3}{7}$, the numerator is –3 and the denominator is 7.

-  Are integers also rational numbers?

Any integer can be thought of as a rational number. For example, the integer – 5 is a rational number, because you can write it as $\frac{-5}{1}$. The integer 0 can also be written as 0 = $\frac{0}{2}$ or $\frac{0}{7}$ Hence, it is also a rational number.
Thus, rational numbers include integers and fractions.

**Equivalent rational numbers**
A rational number can be written with different numerators and denominators. For example, consider the rational number $\frac{-2}{3}$.
$$\frac{-2}{3} = \frac{-2\times2}{3\times2} = \frac{-4}{6}$$ We see that $\frac{-2}{3}$ is same as $\frac{-4}{6}$.

Also, $$\frac{-2}{3} = \frac{(-2)\times(-5)}{3\times(-5)} = \frac{10}{-15}$$ So $\frac{-2}{3}$ is same as $\frac{10}{-15}$.

Thus, $\frac{-2}{3} = \frac{-4}{6} = \frac{10}{-15}$. Such rational numbers that are equal to each other are said to be equivalent to each other.

Again,  $\frac{10}{-15} = \frac{-15}{10}$ (How?)

*By multiplying the numerator and denominator of a rational number by the same non zero integer, we obtain another rational number equivalent to the given rational number. This is exactly like obtaining equivalent fractions.*

Just as multiplication, the division of the numerator and denominator
by the same non zero integer, also gives equivalent rational numbers. For
example,
 $\frac{10}{-15} = \frac{10\div(-5)}{-15\div(-5)} = \frac{-2}{3}$,        $\frac{-12}{24} = \frac{-12\div12}{24\div12} = \frac{-1}{2}$

> We write $\frac{-2}{3}$ as  -$\frac{2}{3}$, $\frac{-10}{15}$ as  -$\frac{10}{15}$

## 8.4   POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RATIONAL NUMBERS
Conside the rational number $\frac{2}{3}$. Both the numerator and denominator of this number are Such a rational number is called a **positive rational number**. So,  $\frac{3}{8}$, $\frac{5}{7}$, $\frac{2}{9}$ etc. are positive rational numbers.

> **TRY THESE**
> 1. Is 5 a positive rational number?
> 2. List five more positive rational number.

The numerator of $\frac{-3}{5}$ is a negative integer, whereas the denominator is a positive integer. Such a rational number is called a **negative rational number**. So,  $\frac{-5}{7}$, $\frac{-3}{8}$, $\frac{-9}{5}$ etc. are negative rational numbers.

>  **TRY THESE**
> 1. Is -8 a negative rational number?
> 2. List five more negative rational number.

- Is $\frac{8}{-3}$ a negative rational number? We know that
$\frac{8}{-3} = \frac{8\times(-1)}{-3\times(-1)} = \frac{-8}{3}$, and $\frac{-8}{3}$ is a negative rational number. So,  $\frac{8}{-3}$ is a negative rational number.
Similarly, $\frac{5}{-7}$, $\frac{6}{-5}$, $\frac{2}{-9}$ etc. are all negative rational numbers. Note that their numerators are positive and their denominators negative.

- The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number.

- What about $\frac{-3}{-5}$?
You see that $\frac{-3}{-5} = \frac{-3\times(-1)}{-5\times(-1)} = \frac{3}{5}$.  $\frac{-3}{-5}$ is a positive rational number.
Thus, $\frac{-2}{-5}$, $\frac{-5}{-3}$ etc. are positive rational numbers.
